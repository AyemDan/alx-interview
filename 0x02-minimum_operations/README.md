## 0x02. Minimum Operations

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific result.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE

### Project Structure

- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the function `minOperations(n)` that calculates the minimum number of operations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

### Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, import it into your Python script and call it with the desired number:

```python
from 0-minoperations import minOperations

n = 10
print(minOperations(n))  # Output will be the minimum number of operations
```

### Example

For `n = 9`, the minimum number of operations is 6:

1. Copy All (1 operation)
2. Paste (2 operations)
3. Paste (3 operations)
4. Copy All (4 operations)
5. Paste (5 operations)
6. Paste (6 operations)
