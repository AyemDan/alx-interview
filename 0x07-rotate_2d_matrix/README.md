# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is represented by a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To use the function, simply import it and pass your 2D matrix as an argument.

```python
from rotate_2d_matrix import rotate_2d_matrix

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

## Example
Given the following 2D matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

After rotation, it becomes:

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```
